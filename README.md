## Functionality

The 'Deal!' button deals a hand of five card to our two players, Ted and Louis. The 'Check Winner' button calculates the winner according to [poker hand rankings](https://www.cardplayer.com/rules-of-poker/hand-rankings), and displays the winner's name with an explanation of why their hand won.
